            <p class="body-text">Every time 4'33" is recited, people hear a different "melody." Back in high school, I gave my friends a listen and asked them to describe the piece. Some said it was jarring, while others thought it was calm. But all of them thought the song was unserious. And that's exactly what people have been saying for decades.</p>

            <blockquote>4'33" is a joke!</blockquote>

            <p class="body-text">Before I continue whatever-mysterious-composition-I-am-talking-about, I'm sure this essay would be so much better if you plug in your headphones and give 4'33" a listen.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 50vh; font-size: 32px;">...</div>
            
            <p class="body-text">Oh, don't leave yet; I have not finished!</p>

            <p class="body-text">What you just witnessed was indeed an on-paper equivalent of 4'33" (for those who don't have earphones with them!). Yes, the piece was 4 minutes and 33 seconds worth of <em><strong>silence.</strong></em></p>

            <blockquote>Woodstock, August 29, 1952.</blockquote>

            <p class="body-text">People at the premiere of John Cage's 4'33" came with expectations, but left either upset, or questioning. The most spoken line of that day in New York, if there was one, would have been <em>"What a f*cking joke!"</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a></p>

            <p class="body-text">Some words about Cage. He was well-regarded as one of the most influential and creative experimental composers of the 20th century, but 4'33" particularly made him notorious. This unique idea sparked around 1947-1948, when Cage was working on his piano cycle called "Sonatas and Interludes." So, it technically took him an insane five years just to come up with a piece of nearly five minutes of nothing.</p>

            <p class="body-text">Without a doubt, 4'33" earned itself and the composer quite a stir in opinions. The premiere was full of coughing, fidgeting, giggles, whispers, and even some sighs of frustration. Although most of the audience were contemporary music enthusiasts, his premiere unfortunately turned into a widespread scandal and a typical epitome of a joke in music.</p>

            <p class="body-text">However, some music critics justified Cage's intention and dismissed the notion of 4'33" as an infamous hoax. Kyle Gann was one of them.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "[It was] one of the most misunderstood pieces of music ever written and yet, at times, one of the avant-garde's best understood as well."<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>
            </blockquote>

            <p class="body-text">I remember my piano teacher during middle school introduced me to 4'33", and he emphasized, <em>"be in the place you love the most."</em> So, I gave it my first listen while sitting on a beach. At first, it was just chaotic thoughts that popped out in my head.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>What is this? When's lunch? Why is math so hard???</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 36pt;">Hey, stop thinking....</p>
                <p>(Something like that)</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p class="body-text">1 minute, then 2, then 3, and 4, that noisy voice lined up, then vanished gradually. What was left was only some casual bird chirps and rustling. Total peace. That was, as some spiritual practices often say, the power of silence.</p>

            <p class="body-text">Silence is usually defined as the absence of sound. But for Cage and 4'33", silence is more than that. The composition essentially gives up the composer's intention, leaving it to the performer. As an enthusiastic student of Zen Buddhism, Cage established the concept of <em>"unimpededness and interpenetration"</em> in music. He explored the fact that sounds are sequentially pairing up with each other (interpenetrating) but are separated by pauses (unimpeded), therefore putting emphasis on silence (in fact, as a central concept in Zen, silence gives a moment to resolve with the body).</p>

            <p class="body-text">As powerful as it seems, absolute silence was impossible to achieve. On his visit to the anechoic chamber at Harvard, he described a phenomenon that was the opposite of his expectations.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "I heard two sounds, one high and one low. When I described them to the engineer in charge, he informed me that the high one was my nervous system in operation, the low one my blood in circulation."<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>
            </blockquote>

            <p class="body-text">Sometimes, the music we think we hear is never actually the music as it's played: our thoughts add meaning, feelings, and context to the melodies. Sounds exist everywhere around us, and it's our perception that makes "silence" silence.</p>

            <p class="body-text">I am still surprised that no one had thought of a composition of just silence until 1952 (or maybe there were, but not as well-known). As a two-year practitioner of Zen and meditation, I agree that 4'33" (or "relative" silence) offers a tranquil moment to slow down and refresh. It is unfortunate that most musicians regard it more as a musical meme, because there was so much deep down under a seemingly superficial composition; and similarly, there is more to silence than just silence.</p>

                <h2>"Why are you so <span class="section-subtitle">quiet</span>?"</h2>

                <p class="body-text">Pretty much an introvert, I was always more reserved during social gatherings or meetings. So that was one of the most common questions I received. It reflects how people often view the presence of sound as the norm and silence as something unusual. In many situations, being extroverted is more recognized, while being reserved is simply less expected. Of course, this isn't a generalization; rather, it's just an observation of what tends to be normal. In that sense, 4'33", like a strong warrior, challenges conventional expectations.</p>

                <p class="body-text">Eventually, they are crucial reminders for us to rethink and rediscover the meaning of overlooked ideas such as silence, because</p>
